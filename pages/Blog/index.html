            <h1>How to Setup Gimp for Pixel Art</h1>
            <h2>by RaincloudDev 2022</h2>
            <p>
                Gimp is a super good free program thats been around for years
                i've known about it since i was in elementary school and have used
                it for the last five or six years for various projects. It might seem
                clunky at first, but spend a few hours on it and you too can be A SUPER GIMP.
                
                install the program from the website (gimp.org) or use your cli to get the job done.
                whichever way you choose, be sure you are getting your files from a trusted source.
                
                extract the files to the desired location, and you're ready to start manipulating images!
                
            </p>
            
                
            <h1>SETUP YOUR PROJECT</h1>
            <div class="verticalDesc">
                <p>on the top left, click <strong> file>New. </strong>to create a new project</p>
                
                <img src="../Blog/blogImages/01.png">
                <p> in this window you can set the dimensions of your project in pixels, inches or many other units.
                    you'll also notice there are options for landscape and portrait mode below 
                    for this example set your dimensions to 200x200 pixels(px)
                    click OK</p>
            </div>

            <h1>SETUP BRUSHES FOR PIXEL ART</h1>
            <div>
                <p>
                    You've opened a new project! That mess of tools in front of you will be your friend before you know it!
    on the left you'll find some of the available tools including Move, multiple selection tools, a crop tool, 
    bucket fill and more.

    The one we're going to focus on in this article is the paintbrush tool. Notice how maky of the tools have a small 
    arrow in the bottom right of their icon? That means there are even MORE tools to choose from.  

    Right Click the Paintbrush tool and select the pencil tool.
    you should see the tool title change once the selection has been made.

            <div>
            <p>
                From here we're going to head back to the top and click Edit>Preferences
                (Preferences is toward the bottom of the edit menu)
                
                
                Arrow down four times or click "Tool Options"
                underneath "Scaling" is a dropdown menu titled "Default Interpolation"
                this menu should be set to "None." 
            </p>
            </div>

                Now your pencil doesnt leave aliased marks around everything you draw, allowing you to make precise
                changes to any kind of image you're editing. These settings are my go-to settings when starting 
                up a pixel art project. Use the size of the brush to your advantage when you decide the final resolution
                of your game. you can go as small or as large as you like!
